# OS4001-Final
Final Project of OS (operating system) Course, Scheduling Processes.

- Group members: Esmail Mahjoor - Farahnaz Eslami.
- Using MVC structure.
- Tried to implement it expandable, so it's kinda easy to add new methods of `Process Schedule`.
- Text and graphical user interface support.
